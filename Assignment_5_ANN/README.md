Nearest NEighbors Algorithms 
Using any data set you want, implement colabs for the following ANN algorithms (see hints) - showcase proper metrics for this as well.

a) LSH from scratch, Random projections from scratch

FAISS library based or any other popular library based colabs for

b) exhaustive search

c) product quantization

d) trees and graphs
